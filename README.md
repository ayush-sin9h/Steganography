# Steganography
This is my project dealing with the affairs of secure data hiding in images using steganography
## Unique Features of Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography:-

<br>1.Double Security with Encryption:-</br>
<input type="radio">Encrypts data using AES before embedding it into an image for added protection.
Combines password-based encryption and steganography to enhance security.

<br>2.Intelligent Pixel Encoding:-</br>
Uses a randomized pixel pattern instead of sequential embedding to prevent easy detection.
Adapts Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding to minimize visible distortions.

<br>3.AI Integration for Optimization:-</br>
AI detects hidden data vulnerabilities and suggests the best encoding strategy based on image characteristics.
