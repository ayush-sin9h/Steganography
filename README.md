# 🔐 Steganography: Secure Data Hiding in Images

This project focuses on securely hiding data within images using **steganography** techniques, enhanced with encryption and AI-based optimization.

---

## 🚀 Unique Features

### 1. 🔒 Double Security with Encryption
- Encrypts data using **AES** before embedding it into an image.
- Combines **password-based encryption** with steganography for enhanced security.

### 2. 🎨 Intelligent Pixel Encoding
- Uses a **randomized pixel pattern** instead of sequential embedding to avoid easy detection.
- Employs **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** encoding with adaptive techniques to minimize visible distortions.

### 3. 🤖 AI Integration for Optimization
- AI analyzes image characteristics to detect vulnerabilities.
- Suggests the **optimal encoding strategy** for better stealth and performance.
