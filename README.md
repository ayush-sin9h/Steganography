# Steganography
<body>This is my project dealing with the affairs of secure data hiding in images using steganography</body>
# Unique Features of Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography:-
<b>Double Security with Encryption:-</b>
<input type="radio">Encrypts data using AES before embedding it into an image for added protection.
Combines password-based encryption and steganography to enhance security.
<b>Intelligent Pixel Encoding:-</b>
Uses a randomized pixel pattern instead of sequential embedding to prevent easy detection.
Adapts Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding to minimize visible distortions.
AI Integration for Optimization:-
AI detects hidden data vulnerabilities and suggests the best encoding strategy based on image characteristics.

This approach ensures better security, stealth, and usability, making it superior to traditional methods. 🚀
